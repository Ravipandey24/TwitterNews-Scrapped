# TwitterNews-scrapped

-> It is a simple yet useful project where I scrapped some Twitter News profiles and collected their latest tweets based on likes they got.

-> Tweets are stored in csv file containing ID, DateTime, Content, Source, URL and Likes of the tweet.

-> packages required = "pandas", "snscrape"
                    
-> usage :
            - clone the repository by executing "git clone https://github.com/Ravipandey24/TwitterNews-scrapped.git" \n
            - install the packages by executing "pip install pandas && pip install snscrape" \n
            - cd to the folder and run the script "python index.py" \n
            - After execution a news.csv file will be available. \n
